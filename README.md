# Build MonoDevelop on OS X

Building MonoDevelop on OS X is hard; the instructions are long, complicated, outdated, and incomplete. There are many steps.

The goal of this repo is to make building MonoDevelop on OS X as easy as:

```shell
$ curl -L bit.ly/1zCQCam | ruby
```

There are still some kinks to work out (not all prerequisites are acquired). If you have any issues, please report them.
